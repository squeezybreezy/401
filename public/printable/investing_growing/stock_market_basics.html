            <h2>Hello, Future Investor!</h2>
            <p>In "401Kid," Walter Clarke talks about how owning stocks is one way to build wealth over time. But what exactly are stocks? And how does the stock market work? Let's explore the exciting world of investing in companies!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stock-section">
            <h3>What is a Stock?</h3>
            
            <div class="stock-definition">
                <p>A <strong>stock</strong> is a small piece of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a part-owner (or shareholder) of that company!</p>
                <p>Companies sell stocks to raise money to grow their business. In return, as an owner, you might:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make money if the company's value grows (the stock price goes up)</li>
                    <li>Receive dividends (a share of the company's profits)</li>
                    <li>Get to vote on important company decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>stock market</strong> is where people buy and sell stocks. It's like a marketplace for company ownership!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="stock-section">
            <h3>Companies You Might Know</h3>
            <p>Many companies you're familiar with sell stocks that anyone can buy:</p>

            <h3>How Stocks Work</h3>
            
            <p>Let's say a company called "Super Lemonade" wants to expand and build more lemonade stands. They need $1,000 to do this.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>They decide to sell 100 shares of stock at $10 each</li>
                <li>You buy 1 share for $10, so you own 1% of the company</li>
                <li>The company uses your money (and money from other investors) to build more lemonade stands</li>
                <li>If the company does well and makes more profit, your stock might increase in value to $15</li>
                <li>You could sell your stock and make $5 profit, or keep it and hope it grows even more!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The price of a stock changes based on how well people think the company is doing and how many people want to buy or sell the stock.</p>

            <h4>Note for Parents:</h4>
            <p>This activity introduces the basic concepts of stock market investing, which Walter Clarke discusses in 401Kid as an important way to build wealth over time. Understanding how company ownership works helps children develop a more sophisticated view of money and investing.</p>
            <p>To enhance this activity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discuss companies your family uses or knows about that are publicly traded</li>
                <li>Consider setting up a small investment account for your child with fractional shares</li>
                <li>Use free stock market simulators online to practice investing without real money</li>
                <li>Talk about the importance of long-term investing and not panicking when markets go down</li>
                <li>Discuss how index funds can be a simpler way to own many companies at once</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As Clarke emphasizes in the book, teaching children about investing in assets like stocks helps them understand how to make their money work for them, rather than just working for money. This mindset shift is crucial for building long-term wealth.</p>
