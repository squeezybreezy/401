            <p>In "401Kid," Walter Clarke talks about "planting mighty trees with deep roots" through real estate and "cultivating reliable plants" through business ownership. These are powerful ways to build wealth over time. Let's explore how owning real estate and businesses can help you create financial freedom!</p>

                    <p>Real estate means land and buildings. When you own real estate, you own physical property that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can increase in value over time</li>
                        <li>Can generate income through rent</li>
                        <li>Provides shelter (a basic need)</li>
                        <li>Can be improved to increase its value</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="property-image">COMMERCIAL BUILDING</div>
                    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Higher rents, longer leases, business tenants</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> More expensive, complex regulations</p>

                    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> No maintenance, can increase in value, many uses</p>

            </div>
            
            <h4>Real Estate Math Example</h4>
            <p>Let's see how a rental property might work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You buy a small apartment for $100,000</li>
                <li>You rent it out for $1,000 per month ($12,000 per year)</li>
                <li>Your expenses (mortgage, taxes, insurance, repairs) are $800 per month ($9,600 per year)</li>
                <li>Your profit is $200 per month ($2,400 per year)</li>
                <li>Plus, the property might increase in value by 3% each year ($3,000 in the first year)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Try this calculation:</p>
            <p>If you bought a property for $200,000 and rented it for $1,800 per month with expenses of $1,500 per month:</p>
            <p>Monthly profit: $________</p>
            <p>Yearly profit: $________</p>
            <p>If the property increases in value by 4% per year, that's an additional $________ in the first year</p>

            <h4>Note for Parents:</h4>
            <p>This activity introduces the concepts of real estate and business ownership that Walter Clarke discusses in chapters 14-16 of 401Kid. Understanding these wealth-building assets helps children see beyond traditional employment as their only future income source.</p>
            <p>To enhance this activity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Share your own experiences with real estate or business ownership, if applicable</li>
                <li>Point out local businesses and discuss how they create value and generate income</li>
                <li>Explain how mortgages work and how real estate can be purchased with a down payment</li>
                <li>Discuss how small businesses in your community started and grew over time</li>
                <li>Consider helping your child start a very small business to experience ownership firsthand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As Clarke emphasizes in the book, teaching children about these ownership opportunities expands their financial horizons and helps them understand how wealth is built over generations. These concepts connect directly to the "invest" face of the Five Faces of a Dollar framework.</p>
