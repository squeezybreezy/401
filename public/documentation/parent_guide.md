# 401Kid Financial Activities - User Guide for Parents

## Introduction
Welcome to the 401Kid Financial Activities package! This collection of printable activities and interactive tools is designed to complement Walter Clarke's "401Kid" book and help you teach your children important financial concepts in engaging, age-appropriate ways.

## How to Use This Package

### Getting Started
1. **Assess your child's level**: The activities are organized by age group, but feel free to choose based on your child's interest and understanding rather than strictly by age.
